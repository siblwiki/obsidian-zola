🖱️ A process by which **we check that our *measures* are accurate in our papers**.

In order to do this, RAs check either the hard copies of the paper surveys or the Qualtrics survey online against the wording we have reported in the latest draft of the paper.

</aside>

Steps:

1. Find the correct survey on Qualtrics or get the folder with the paper surveys from the file cabinets.
2. **Check against the methods section of the paper**: When you have found the section of the paper where we talk about our questionnaire you will highlight red or green depending on whether or not it matches the paper/Qualtrics survey.
    
    **Note.** Sometimes the lab manager will simply send you the relevant section via email.
    
    - Highlight any words/phrases/sentences that are inaccurately reported in the paper **red**.
    - Highlight any words/phrases/sentences that are accurately reported in the paper **green**.
    - Put comments on the red highlighted sections that say what the correct wording should be.
    
    Send the paper/relevant section back to the lab manager with the highlights and comments. See below for an example.
    
    ```
    In Study 2, 193 undergraduate students filled out a paper survey on campus. They were asked 2 questions about their choice of major: “How likely would you be to choose a major that is boring?” and “How interested would you be in choosing a major that is exciting?”. Answers were reported on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 “Not at all” to 7 “Very likely”.

3. In doing this check it is very important to let the lab manager/your supervisor know if you notice anything strange. Even if it seems small to you, it could be a big issue later on if not corrected!
