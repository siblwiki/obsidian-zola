1. Do an initial read-through for clarity issues, sentences that could sound better
2. Read all text (out loud or backward by sentence) – including figure captions, footnotes, etc
3. Pay special attention to tense because I have a bad habit of switching from past to present (e.g., "we predict" vs. "we predicted")
4. Make sure title on cover page matches title on intro page
5. Check APA 6th style (especially headings)
6. Check figures and tables to make sure bars (figures) and numbers (tables) match up to what is in or implied by the text.
7. Check figures and tables are references properly in the text (e.g., Figure 1).
8. Look through references and mark any errors in capitalizations
9. Check footnotes to make sure they are numbered correctly and their position in the text makes sense
10. Proofread cover letter (if there is one)
11. Check if arithmetic means in results section match the text (e.g., mean should be higher for condition that generated “greater anger”)
12. Check variable names to make sure they don’t shift around in a confusing manner (e.g., anticipated success vs. performance expectations, interest vs. course enrollment intentions)
