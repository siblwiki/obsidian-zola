## **Overview**

UWâ€™s IRB is call the Human Subjects Division. They handle all concerns related to submitting IRBs, modifications to studies, and status reports. The Psychology Department is assigned to IRB committee E/B led by Galen Basse ([gkbasse@uw.edu](mailto:gkbasse@uw.edu)). You can go to him with general IRB questions.

## Types of IRBs

- Our lab typically submits exempt or minimal risk IRBs. These are the lowest grades of IRBs. Exempt is the least risk and minimal risk is slightly higher risk. HSD has guides on which IRB types should be used.

## Zipline

- Zipline is the online IRB system where you submit applications and forms.
- You can make a Zipline account using your UW Net ID on this page: [https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/zipline/](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/zipline/).
- All materials and studies must be approved by Sapna before submission.
