There are a few bureaucratic matters that must be taken care of before becoming a full-fledged lab member. These include registering with the department as either a 499 student or a volunteer and completing the human subjects’ tutorial. It is also optional to attend a Psychology human subjects meeting at the beginning of the quarter.

### [Lab Expectations](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=About%20SIBL%2FLab%20Expectations)


### **Registering as a 499 or volunteer**

If you are a 499, you will need to register for 499 credit (either 2 or 3 credits depending on the number of hours you work per week). You will also need to get a 499 registration card from the main office and have Sapna or a graduate student sign it. Upon returning it, you will need to turn in a lab syllabus, which you can get from the lab manager.

All volunteers (**non-UW students**) in the psychology department must have:

- A background check done. Contact Melissa on the first floor (payroll) to do this.
- Volunteer ID’s for UW use which need to be created at the front desk (do NOT have Melissa make the volunteer ID).
- Checked with the front desk (GTH 119A) on whether they need to complete the volunteer form (see Appendix), hard copies available on the first floor.
- CITI training certificate

UW students do not need any of those. They can get keys directly and start working about being trained and finishing the CITI training.

### **Completing the human subjects tutorial – CITI Training**

Before being allowed to run subjects, you must complete the certification training for human subjects online. It takes an hour or two, and when you are done, it will allow you email a certificate of completion that you can bring it to the lab manager during your first week in the lab.

Instructions on the overall process: www.washington.edu/research/hsd/training/required-training/web-based-citi-training/

Once you finish the training, please email/send a message through Teams the PDF of your Certification in the following naming format: lastname_firstname_CITITrainingCertificate.pdf

Note: 
1. Make sure you ONLY do the Basic course - Stage 1 "Research with Human Subjects"
2. Please take your time to complete the training as it contains important information. However, you are not required to take notes or memorize any of the information
3. If you have already taken the training before, you can just take the Refresher

### Chain of Command

A certain chain of command is followed when a question arises.

1. If a question is in relation to a specific study, you can directly ask the **graduate student** who is supervising the study, or you can ask the lab manager.
2. Utilize your resources. Try to find the answer yourself first.
3. If you still cannot figure it out, talk to **other RAs** in the lab. Questions for other RAs would be things like, “What rooms are available?”, “Can you help me decipher this handwriting for data entry?”, or other logistical things like how to print in lab or program a survey.
4. If it is still not resolved and the **lab manager** is available, then bring the issue to them.
5. Generally, if you have a question you want to ask Sapna, ask the **lab manager** first. If it is urgent that you ask Sapna personally, you can approach her before or after lab meeting; non-urgent questions can also be asked during 1-on-1s with Sapna (which occur bi-quarterly).

### Scheduling Lab Hours Instructions

We ask that SIBL RAs put their lab hours into the **shared SIBL Google Calendar.**

It is very important because lab manager(s) need to know when each of you is working so they can assign you your tasks for the day. You are free to divide the 9 hours/week however you like and/or best fits your schedule (see screenshot below for example). Please just make sure to indicate if you are doing the hours remotely or in-person.

If you want your hours to be the same each week (most RAs do), please create a recurring event (**until specified date)** (last day of instruction for specified quarter). 

Lab manager(s) typically work 9am-5pm PT Monday through Friday, so that's when they are available via Teams/email. BUT, you are free to schedule hours outside of those hours (although that does mean I won't be as easy to reach).

### SIBL Account

- Contact lab manager for SIBL log-in credentials

#### Instructions

1. You can access the SIBL google account with the above credentials.
    
    **Note:**  When you try to log in for the first time, it will ask for a **confirmation number.**
    
    The number will be sent to lab manager so **please let me know before you enter the login info**. You both will get on a quick Zoom call or both be in Teams chat so lab manager can give you the number.
    
2. Open the Google Calendar app and go to the specified week.
3. Enter in when you are available by creating an event in your calendar. To create an event, click on the date and time you would like to mark. In the *Calendar* section, use the drop down menu to select the calendar with your name.

4. In the *What* section, enter your name. The event should include the hours you will be able to work in lab (e.g., Mondays from 12:30pm to 3:30pm).
