We are a social psychology lab at the Department of Psychology at University of Washington. We are interested in understanding how people's choices and behaviors are shaped by cultural factors such as stereotypes and social identity. Our lab is primarily concerned with developing and empirically testing theories that inform current social problems, particularly inequality and prejudice, in the hopes of bringing attention to these problems and working towards feasible solutions.
