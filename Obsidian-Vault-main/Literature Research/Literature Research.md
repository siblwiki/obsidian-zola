# Literature Research

The first step in initiating a new line of research or preparing a grant proposal involves obtaining the research articles that will form the basis of new theories. This process is known as a literature search or, more commonly, a lit search. Generally speaking, the graduate student or professor who is undertaking the research will conduct their own lit searches. However, there are times when members of the lab will be asked to help find articles from a list provided by the primary investigator. Psychological literature can be found in two primary forms: chapters in books and articles in scholarly journals.

While books can be found in the UW library or through loans from other libraries, journal articles can be trickier to find. The UW has access to a wide array of journals via its electronic resources. The following will briefly demonstrate how you might go about searching for books and journals using UW’s online resources.

For any lit search, you’re going to start at the University Libraries website:
